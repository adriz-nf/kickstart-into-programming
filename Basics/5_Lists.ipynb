    "Strings and lists are two kinds of iterables that we have looked at today. There are many other kinds of iterables that we'll work with in Python, and you can even define your own iterable if you'd like. The important thing that we want to note for now, though, is that the `for` loops that we have looked at today will work for any iterable. You can simply write `for <variable name> in <iterable>:`, and at each iteration through the loop you will be able to access another element from that iterable via `variable name`. Also, as mentioned above, the `list()` constructor accepts any iterable as an argument, and then creates a `list`, where each element in the iterable is a single element in the `list`."
