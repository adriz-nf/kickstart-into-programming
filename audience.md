# Why should you particiate in this course?
This course is designed to help build foundational skills and give fundamental knowlegde of computer programming. It is to be thought of as a one day stand alone program that will provide a introduction into programming rather than any expert knowldge or skill building.

# Who is this course for?
The intented audience of this course is participants in the proTechnicalle program. 
This means young adults who are intested in learning about MINT/STEM topics.  
The assumption is that the audience bring good understanding of high school level math and physics.  
Specificly, general knowledge of algebra, formulas and functions combined with good problem solving experience gives a good starting point for all participants to follow course material.
Prior experience in coding, programming is not expected. Any prior experience will allow deeper understanding of topics in the course.

# What is the expected outcome?
At the end of the course/day, particpants will know:
What they will learn in future programming courses  
What are some potential next steps to go deeper into the topics  
There should be no barriers left preventing particpants from getting started in programming and coding.
