    "Mainly, we will work with Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), which \" ... are documents that combine live runnable code with narrative text (Markdown), equations (LaTeX), images, interactive visualizations and other rich output\"([Source](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/notebook.html)).  \n",
